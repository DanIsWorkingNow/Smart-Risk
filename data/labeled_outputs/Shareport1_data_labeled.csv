ABSTRACT
Sharīʿah compliance in Islāmic banks is important to provide confidence and
assurance to the public, as well as improve the credibility of Islāmic banking
operations in the financial market.",2
"Islāmic banks can be potentially exposed
to the Sharīʿah non-compliance risk if the operations and business activities
do not adhere to Sharīʿah principles.",2
"In light of this, Sharīʿah risk
management is very important in Islāmic banks.",2
"The Central Bank of
Malaysia (Bank Negara Malaysia) requires Islāmic banks to incorporate
Sharīʿah risk management practices as part of the necessary Sharīʿah
functions in Islāmic banking institutions.",2
"This is part of the Sharīʿah
Governance Policy Document, issued by Bank Negara Malaysia in 2019.",2
"The
Sharīʿah risk management function is to systematically identify, measure,
monitor and control Sharīʿah non-compliance risk and mitigate any potential
non-compliance events.",2
"This is consistent with the other two Sharīʿah control
functions, which involve Sharīʿah review and Sharīʿah audit.",2
"Within this
setting, the present study is conducted to examine the existing Sharīʿah risk
management practices in selected Islāmic banks in Malaysia as well as
providing recommendations on the best Sharīʿah risk management practices.",2
Institutional theory and contingency theory are used in this study.,2
"Interviews
with several key officers from selected Islāmic banks were conducted to
obtain their views on Sharīʿah risk management practices since they are
involved directly in managing Sharīʿah non-compliance risks in their
respective banks.",2
"Findings showed that existing Sharīʿah risk management
practices in Islāmic banks are similar to those of conventional banking
institutions in terms of risk identification, risk measurement, risk monitoring
and controlling, and risk reporting.",1
"Nonetheless, for Sharīʿah risk
management, the focus was on managing Sharīʿah non-compliance since
Sharīʿah requirements need to be adhered to at all times.",2
"All of the
interviewees from the selected banks agreed that the risk identification stage
is the most crucial in Sharīʿah risk management.",2
"The implication of the study
is to have a Sharīʿah risk management framework for Islāmic banks so that
practices are consistently used.",2
"In addition, this can assist the Sharīʿah audit
102 International Journal of Economics, Management and Accounting 30, no.",2
"1 (2022)
in conducting risk-based audit.",2
"Bank Negara Malaysia should also play a role
by issuing guidelines on Sharīʿah risk management as a guidance for Islāmic
banks in Malaysia.",2

"INTRODUCTION
The Islāmic Financial Services Board (2005) stated that Sharīʿah non-
compliance risk arises from Islāmic banking institutions’ inability to
adhere to the Sharīʿah rules and principles established by an
institution’s own Sharīʿah Board or the relevant bodies in the
jurisdiction where Islāmic banking institutions operate.",2
"Sharīʿah
compliance is crucial to Islāmic banking institution practice, and such
compliance necessity must be infused throughout the organization, its
products, and activities.",2
"Since most fund providers use Sharīʿah-
compliant banking services, their perceptions of Islāmic bank
compliance with Sharīʿah rules and principles are critical for their
sustainability.",2
"In this respect, Sharīʿah non-compliance risk is deemed
the highest priority compared to other recognized risks.",2
"If Islāmic
banks do not comply with Sharīʿah rules and principles, their
transactions ought to be void, and any income made from them must
be channelled to charitable organizations.",0
"Consequently, an efficient
Sharīʿah risk management is crucial in managing Sharīʿah non-
compliance risk and to improve institutional integrity and stakeholder
confidence.",2
"The Sharīʿah risk management progression does follow
the conventional risk management procedure by including risk
identification, risk measurement, risk monitoring and controlling, and
risk reporting in the operations, business affairs, and activities of the
Islāmic Financial Institutions (Sharīʿah Governance Policy
Document, 2019).",2
"However, the type of risks to be managed for
Sharīʿah risk management is different which is the Sharīʿah non-
compliance risk.",2
"Risk management, which is also relevant to Islāmic
banks is for managing credit risk, market risk, liquidity risk and
operational risk.",2
"Since Sharīʿah risk management is one of the important
Sharīʿah control functions in Islāmic banks to provide the support to
the Sharīʿah committee in providing assurance on Sharīʿah
Shariah Risk Management Practices in Malaysian Islāmic Banks 103
compliance, Islāmic banks must ensure that oversight and
management of the overall Sharīʿah non-compliance risk is structured
such that the senior officers entrusted with control functions under
Sharīʿah governance are able to exercise clear accountability over
Sharīʿah non-compliance risk (Sharīʿah Governance Policy
Document, 2019).",2
"This can instill and strengthen the Sharīʿah
compliance culture to improve compliant behavior level.",2
"This paper intends to examine the process affecting Sharīʿah
risk management practices in selected Islāmic banking institutions in
Malaysia and to offer recommendations on the most effective Sharīʿah
risk management practices.",2
"This study is significant to the field of
Islāmic banking in Malaysia and is related to the literature as it
explores the Sharīʿah risk management practices in Islāmic banking
institutions in Malaysia.",2
"As it is important for Islāmic banks to
establish an effective Sharīʿah risk management in controlling the
Sharīʿah non-compliance risk, the results of this study will add value
to improving the integrity of Islāmic Financial Institutions (IFIs) in
Malaysia and increase confidence of their stakeholders.",2
"BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY
Islāmic banking institutions in Malaysia have begun to rise over the
previous four decades from the formation of Tabung Haji, full-fledged
Islāmic banks, Islāmic banking subsidiaries, Takaful institutions and
Islāmic capital market.",0
"With the high growth of Islāmic banking
institutions, in particular Islāmic banks, Sharīʿah compliance has
become the most crucial matter observed by the stakeholders who
participate in Islāmic banking business operations.",2
"The stakeholders
who have invested in Islāmic banks are interested in ensuring that their
investment has been ventured faithfully into a Sharīʿah compliant
business (Grais and Pellegrini, 2006).",1
"Therefore, Islāmic banks need
to operate in accordance with Sharīʿah principles to enhance
stakeholder confidence.",2
"In 2010, Bank Negara Malaysia, as the
regulator, has established the Shariah Governance Framework to
provide a comprehensive guideline for Islāmic banking institutions to
deliberate their activities and operations under Sharīʿah principles.",2
"This Shariah Governance Framework (2010) has superseded the
Guidelines on the Governance of Sharīʿah Committee for the IFIs that
regulates the governance of Sharīʿah committee of an Islāmic
Financial Institution in 2004.",2
"The most recent guideline issued by
Bank Negara Malaysia in 2019 is the Shariah Governance Policy
104 International Journal of Economics, Management and Accounting 30, no.",2
"1 (2022)
Document, effective in April 2020 to replace Shariah Governance
Framework (2010).",2
"The Sharīʿah risk management is still an important Sharīʿah
function in the Sharīiah Governance Policy Document (2019) to
ensure effective risk management of Sharīʿah non-compliance.",2
"Sharīʿah non-compliance risk refers to the risk of legal or regulatory
sanctions, financial loss or non-financial consequences, inclusive of
damages to reputations; Islāmic banking institutions may experience
such circumstances from the inability to adhere to the rulings of the
Sharīʿah Advisory Council (SAC) of Bank Negara Malaysia (BNM),
which are standards on Sharīʿah matters issued by the BNM or
decisions or advice of the Sharīʿah committee (Bank Negara
Malaysia, 2019).",2
"The impact of Sharīʿah non-compliance risk
includes non-financial impact, which are affecting the image of IFIs
and not getting blessings from Allah as Sharīʿah Advisory Council’s
rulings are based on the sources of Fiqh Muamalat.",2
"Several other definitions relate to the Sharīʿah non-
compliance risk.",2
"Archer and Haron (2007) defined the risk of Sharīʿah
non-compliance as “the risk of non-compliances resulting from a
failure of an Islāmic bank’s internal systems and personnel”.",2
"Ginena
(2014) asserted that Sharīʿah non-compliance risk is a type of
operational risk which may include the risk of financial losses that an
Islāmic banking institution may face in activities recognized by
relevant authorities in the appropriate jurisdiction resultant of non-
compliance with Sharīʿah principles.",2
"This is in line with the definition
given by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (2011) on
operational risk, which was defined as “the risk of loss resulting from
inadequate or failed internal processes, people, and systems or from
external events.”
Bank Negara Malaysia places such a great importance in
ensuring that the overall Islāmic financial system operates following
Sharīʿah principles.",2
"The introduction of the Islāmic Financial Services
Act 2013 that supersedes the Islāmic Banking Act 1983 imposed more
strict regulations on Islāmic banks in Malaysia compared to before.",2
"Section 28(3) of the Islāmic Financial Services Act 2013. also
regulates the actions to be taken when an Islāmic bank becomes aware
that it is carrying on any of its business, affairs or activities in a manner
not in compliance with Sharīʿah or the advice of its Sharīʿah
committee or the advice or ruling of the Sharīʿah Advisory Council.",2
"The actions require the Islāmic bank to immediately notify Bank
Negara Malaysia and its Sharīʿah committee of the Sharīʿah non-
compliance event and immediately cease from carrying on such
Shariah Risk Management Practices in Malaysian Islāmic Banks 105
business, affair, or activity and from taking on any other similar
business, affair, or activity.",2
"In addition, the Islāmic bank must submit
a plan on rectifying the non-compliance to Bank Negara Malaysia
within 30 days of becoming aware of such non-compliance.",2
"Failure to
do this will result in the conviction, liability to imprisonment for a
term not exceeding eight years or a fine not exceeding 25 million
Malaysian ringgit, or both under Section 28(5) of the Islāmic Financial
Services Act 2013.",2
"According to the Shariah Governance Policy
Document (2010), an efficient and responsible board and
management, an independent Sharīʿah committee that is both
knowledgeable and accountable, assisted by active Sharīʿah review,
Sharīʿah audit, and Sharīʿah risk management’s functions, represents
a sound and robust Shariah Governance Framework.",2
"The Shariah Governance Policy Document (2019) requires
the Sharīʿah risk management function to perform risk management
processes so that Islāmic banks can mitigate any possible events that
could lead to Sharīʿah non-compliance risk.",2
"In this case, the risk
officer works to identify, measure, monitor, and control the Sharīʿah
non-compliance risk as part of the integrated risk management
framework in Islāmic banks.",2
"It is also crucial to highlight those Islāmic
banks need a proper Sharīʿah risk management compared to their
conventional counterparts because Islāmic banks are exposed to
additional risks in their financial operations, which include Sharīʿah
non-compliance risk and reputational risk (Van Greuning and Iqbal,
2008; Mohd Ariffin and Kassim, 2011).",2
"In the aspect of Sharīʿah risk
management processes, Islāmic banks must develop a good risk
management environment, such as an efficient risk measurement,
mitigating and monitoring process together with an effective internal
control (Khan and Ahmed, 2001).",2
"Meanwhile, Sharīʿah compliance is not only related to Islāmic
banking products.",2
"It also involves the structures, processes, people,
and arrangements in Islāmic banks, which relate to the Islāmic
financial operations.",2
"Failure to ensure Sharīʿah compliance in Islāmic
banking activities and operations will lead to Sharīʿah non-
compliance risk, which will jeopardize stakeholder confidence in
Islāmic banking operations.",2
"The crucial need for governance and
Sharīʿah risk management in preventing such losses can be observed
from the disastrous losses experienced by the Ihlas Finance House in
Turkey in 2001 (Ginena, 2014).",2
"In those cases, the Islāmic Financial
Services Board developed the IFSB 1-Guiding Principles of Risk
Management for Institutions (other than insurance institutions), which
offer only Islāmic financial services that provide an inclusive guidance
106 International Journal of Economics, Management and Accounting 30, no.",2
"1 (2022)
for risk management and reporting, including the Sharīʿah non-
compliance risk as part of the operations in Islāmic banking
institutions (Islāmic Financial Services Board, 2005).",2
"It is important
to ensure a good governance system in Islāmic banking institutions is
in place.",2
"There is scarce literature on Sharīʿah risk management
practices since they were only made mandatory in 2011 after the
issuance of the Shariah Governance Framework in 2010 by Bank
Negara Malaysia.",2
"Even in most Islāmic banks, the Sharīʿah risk
management unit did not start too early.",2
"Since Sharīʿah non-
compliance risk is part of operational risk, the tools used for Sharīʿah
risk management is leveraging on the operational risk management
tools.",2
"Hence, there are limited studies on Sharīʿah risk management
practices in the literature.",2
"Nevertheless, since Sharīʿah risk management is deemed as
part of the banking operational risk, several studies on operational risk
management have been examined.",2
"The complexity and fast expansion
of the global banking sector in the past few decades have led to greater
exposure to various kinds of risks, including operational risk.",2
"Since
there is an increasing concern toward operational risk in Islāmic
banking, several recent studies, for example by Abdullah and Shahimi
(2011), Akkizidis and Khandelwal (2008), Archer and Haron (2007),
and Izhar (2010) have highlighted this issue.",2
"The banking sector is classified as a restricted industry as its
operation involves a very high-risk exposure, which requires effective
risk management.",2
"Arora and Agarwal (2009) explained that a bank is
deemed a “risk machine” due to the risks taken, transformed, and
embedded in products and services.",2
"Essentially, in terms of
operational risk, Islāmic banks also encounter similar challenges as
those faced by conventional banks as they also offer financial services
in the various banking activities (Archer and Haron, 2007).",2
"This
indicates that contemporary Islāmic banks face the same general
exposure to operational risk as conventional banks.",2
"Furthermore, due
to the specific contractual characteristics, the exposure to operational
risk in Islāmic banks have the tendency to be critical (Van Greuning
and Iqbal, 2008; Khan and Ahmed, 2001).",2
"Consequently, operational
risk management in Islāmic banks necessitate a more detailed
comprehension of operational risk sources from which losses could
transpire (Izhar, 2010).",2
"The massive losses experienced by some
financial institutions, such as Barings, Daiwa, and Merrill Lynch, were
due to faulty operational risk management; hence, this is one of the
Shariah Risk Management Practices in Malaysian Islāmic Banks 107
crucial reasons for the analysis of operational risk to be considered
highly significant at present (Hull, 2007).",2
"Islāmic banking has grown rapidly since its advent four
decades ago.",2
It serves as an alternative to conventional banking.,1
"One
of the unique characteristics that distinguishes Islāmic banks from
their conventional counterparts is the compliance with Islāmic rules,
i.e., Sharīʿah compliance (Abdelghani and Aziz, 2014).",2
"Although
there have been studies on operational risk in Islāmic banks, no
research is available on management of Sharīʿah non-compliance risk.",2
"Predominantly, Islāmic banking strictly forbids riba’ (usury) or
gharar (uncertainty) and demands all transactions to be halal; hence,
added exposure to a new kind of risk has emerged.",1
"Additionally, Khan
and Ahmed (2001) strongly agreed that, as a result of unique asset and
liability structures in Islāmic banks, they face not only the same risks
as conventional banks but also ""new and unique"" risks compared to
conventional banking.",1
"The new and unique risks to Islāmic banks
include equity risk, rate of return risk, displaced commercial risk and
Sharīʿah non-compliance risk.",2
"Notably, several studies have identified the perception of
Islāmic banks on risk management.",2
"By using a field survey on 17
Islāmic banks from 10 different countries, Khan and Ahmed (2001)
observed the banker perspective on numerous types of risks and issues
linked to the risk management process in Islāmic banking institutions.",2
"The findings exhibited that bankers have rated the mark-up (interest
rate) risk as the most significant risk, followed by operational risk, and
liquidity risk.",1
"This outcome aligns with the study by Hassan (2009) on
the most significant type of risks encountered by Islāmic banks in
Brunei Darussalam.",2
"It was found that operational risk has been ranked
among the top three of risk exposures to Islāmic banks in Brunei
Darussalam.",2
"Meanwhile, Khan and Ahmed (2001) argued that Islāmic
banks have comparatively higher operational risks, and these have a
more extreme impact than credit risk and market risk.",2
"Generally, there is some literature on the unique Sharīʿah non-
compliance risk exposed by Islāmic banking institutions.",2
"(2016) attempted to examine the nature of Sharīʿah non-compliance
risk and investigated its influence on the capital adequacy of Islāmic
banks.",2
"The findings from 51 Islāmic banks in 11 countries showed that
applying an extra capital charge to overcome Sharīʿah non-
compliance risk in Islāmic banks would not achieve the purpose.",2
"The
study further showed that the most applicable way for Islāmic banks
to manage a high level of Sharīʿah non-compliance risk is to utilize
available tools in the existing supervisory review process.",2
"108 International Journal of Economics, Management and Accounting 30, no.",2
"1 (2022)
Since Sharīʿah non-compliance risk can also have a
significant impact on Islāmic banks just like other risks, corporate
governance needs to play its role in risk management regardless of risk
exposure types.",2
"Kaen (2005) showed there is a positive connection
between risk management and corporate governance.",2
"Both risk
management and corporate governance should be integrated (McCrae
and Balthazor, 2000).",2
"In addition, Van Greuning and Bratanovic
(2009) identified the Board of Directors as the “ultimate risk
managers” of a corporation when dealing with risk exposure impact.",2
"As Islāmic banks deal with much more risk exposure, specifically
Sharīʿah non-compliance risk, Ginena (2014) proposed the
importance of Board of Directors to provide risk management
guidelines, to establish a robust risk management strategy, to foster a
culture that stresses the importance of Sharīʿah compliance and to
comment adequately on risk policies and control in annual reports.",2
"Pertaining to the Islāmic bank risk management process,
Rosman (2009) proposed that four important aspects in the process
are: understanding risk and risk management, risk identification, risk
analysis and assessment and risk monitoring, which are similar to the
risk management process in conventional banks.",2
"The study anticipated
a positive correlation between understanding risk and risk
management, risk identification, risk analysis and assessment and risk
reporting with risk management practices in conventional and Islāmic
banks.",2
"The study, however, covered all types of risks in the banks
(credit risk, market risk, liquidity risk, and operational risk), and did
not only limit to the Sharīʿah non-compliance risk.",2
"Embi and Shafii (2019) examined the risk management
practices of Islāmic banks particularly in Malaysia.",2
"Specifically, the
study aimed at investigating the level of the variables of understanding
risk and risk management, risk identification, risk assessment and
analysis, risk monitoring, credit risk analysis, and the risk
management practices.",2
"Their findings showed that Islāmic banks are
effective in their risk management practices.",2
"Risk monitoring was the
most influential variable that affected the banks’ risk management
practices, followed by risk assessment and analysis, risk identification,
credit risk analysis, and understanding risk and risk management.",2
"Basiruddin and Ahmed (2019) investigated the relationship
between corporate governance and Sharīʿah non-compliance risk and
examined the roles of the Sharīʿah committee along with the Board of
Directors in mitigating Sharīʿah non-compliance risk.",2
"The findings
showed that banks with a smaller board size and higher proportion of
independent board members were likely to have lower Sharīʿah non-
Shariah Risk Management Practices in Malaysian Islāmic Banks 109
compliance risk.",2
"The findings also indicated that the financial
expertise and higher frequency of Sharīʿah committee meetings
reduces the Sharīʿah non-compliance risk.",2
"The study, however, did
not cover the Sharīʿah risk management process in Islāmic banks.",2
"In Malaysia, one of the principles highlighted by Bank Negara
Malaysia in the Shariah Governance Framework (2010) is that, in all
Islāmic banks, there should be a robust Sharīʿah compliance function
carried out through the review and audit functions and supported by
risk management control process and internal research capacity.",2
"This
is also similar to the principle mentioned in the Shariah Governance
Policy Document (2019) in the exception of internal Sharīʿah research
function which has now become the secretariat to the Sharīʿah
committee.",2
"However, BNM did not specifically mention how all these
functions should be operationalized in Islāmic banks.",2
"Therefore, the
banks might translate the operation of all these Sharīʿah-related
functions differently based on their level of understanding.",2
"In line with
this, Khalid and Amjad (2012) concluded that in the case of Islāmic
banks in Pakistan, a better understanding of risk and risk management,
as well as risk monitoring and risk analysis could significantly
contribute to Islāmic bank ability in undertaking better risk
management.",2
"Based on the study by Hassan (2011) on 19 Islāmic
banks and 24 conventional banks, the findings showed a positive
relationship exists between risk management practices and
understanding risk, risk identification, risk assessment, risk
monitoring and risk analysis in both bank types.",2
"This implies that
before moving into risk management activities, it is necessary for
management to have a better understanding of risk first.",2
"An Islāmic
financial institution shall ensure that its risk officers who perform the
Sharīʿah risk management function have the requisite knowledge on
Sharīʿah requirements applicable to Islāmic financial business
(Shariah Governance Policy Document, 2019).",2
"In ensuring effectiveness of an organization’s risk
management framework, the board and senior management must
depend on adequate line of defense functions, including monitoring
and assurance within the organization.",2
"The Institute of Internal
Auditors (2013) recommended the “Three Lines of Defense” model to
explain the link among these functions and to be used as a guideline
in dividing responsibilities.",2
"The first line of defense includes the
functions that own and manage risk belonging to the owner or business
unit.",2
"The second line of defense involve functions that supervise or
concentrate on risk management and compliance.",2
"The third line of
defense offers independent assurance in the form of internal audit.",2
"The
110 International Journal of Economics, Management and Accounting 30, no.",2
"1 (2022)
Three Lines of Defense model is highly encouraged to be adopted by
Islāmic banks.",2
"The first line of defense in the case of managing
Sharīʿah non-compliance risk is the business unit (risk owner), the
second line of defense will fall on the Sharīʿah risk management and
Sharīʿah review, whereas the third line of defense is the Sharīʿah
audit.",2
"Hudin and Hamid (2014) suggested that institutional theory
and contingency theory provide the theoretical base for implementing
risk management practices in businesses.",2
"Institutional theory
emphasizes that standard set of rules are mandatory to formulate an
efficient risk management structure which can be achieved through
institutionalization: “the process through which components of formal
structure become widely accepted, as both appropriate and necessary,
and serve to legitimate organizations” (Tolbert and Zucker, 1983).",2
"Therefore, for Sharīʿah risk management, the existence of the
Sharīʿah risk management guidelines at individual Islāmic banks can
enhance the Sharīʿah risk management practice.",2
"Accordingly,
contingency theory suggest that implementation of risk management
practices depends upon firm size, technology, and environment
(Collier and Wood, 2011).",2
"Here, environment includes the policies
from Bank Negara Malaysia, as stipulated in the Sharīʿah Governance
Policy Document (2019) that provides key motivation for enacting
Sharīʿah risk management practices.",2
"From the risk identification aspect, Hassan (2009) discovered
that Islāmic banks in Brunei Darussalam follow these important
methods, namely inspection by Sharīʿah supervisors, executive and
supervisory staff, audit and physical inspection, financial statement
analysis and risk survey for risk identification.",2
"For measuring Sharīʿah
non-compliance risk, Oz et al.",2
"(2016) found that the current method of
measuring operational risk can be used to measure Sharīʿah non-
compliance risk in Islāmic banks.",2
"Therefore, this indicates that there
is no specific measurement introduced by the regulators on how to
specifically measure Sharīʿah non-compliance risk.",2
"Studies by Archer and Haron (2007) found that Islāmic banks
expose a series of operational risks that are dissimilar from those
exposed by conventional banks.",2
"They argued that the complexities of
a number of their products, as well as the relative novelty of the
contemporary financial services industry, in combination with an
Islāmic bank’s fiduciary roles of operating as a Mudarib
(entrepreneur), signify those operational risks are highly substantial
for Islāmic banks.",2
"As the Sharīʿah non-compliance risk is part of the
operational risk of Islāmic banking institutions, this has provided
Shariah Risk Management Practices in Malaysian Islāmic Banks 111
evidence on the importance to manage the Sharīʿah non-compliance
risk effectively.",2
"To ensure that risks are effectively identified and
assessed, and that appropriate controls and responses are in place,
effective risk management requires an effective reporting and review
structure.",2
"Bhatti (2020) discussed Sharīʿah non-compliance risk as a
form of operational risk intending to ensure that operations in the
Islāmic and banking finance industry comply with Sharīʿah
procedures.",2
"The case of Beximco was studied using a comparative and
normative method, as well as a legal analysis.",2
"The study suggested
managing Sharīʿah non-compliance risk by augmenting the
effectiveness of Sharīʿah governance systems with Islāmic banking
and finance arbitration.",2
"Most of the prior studies have examined the risk management
practices in general, while studies undertaken for Sharīʿah risk
management have been limited.",2
"Furthermore, the available literature
has not provided such specific and detailed information as per need,
and specifically, only a few studies have sought to analyze the risk
identification, risk measurement, risk monitoring and controlling and
risk reporting in Islāmic banks.",2
"Hence, this study contributes to filling
this observed gap in the literature on Sharīʿah risk management
practice and is expected to enhance academic studies based on the
current issue and the literature.",2
"RESEARCH METHODOLOGY
For this research, a qualitative research design was employed because
it would allow the use of natural setting, data gathering from multiple
sources, intense involvement of the researcher, and holistic account,
among others (Creswell, 2014).",2
"A qualitative approach is designed to
provide answers to what and how events unfold, to explore and
research topics that require detailed answers (Creswell, 2013).",2
"The
interview method was employed to gauge the perception of relevant
officers in Islāmic banks toward the Sharīʿah risk management
practices in selected Islāmic banks in Malaysia.",2
"Interviewing of
selected interviewees is an important method used by qualitative
researchers.",2
"Purposive sampling is widely used in qualitative research
for identifying and selecting information-rich cases related to the
phenomenon of interest.",1
"The aim is to collect in depth information
from the right interviewees.",2
"Therefore, this study used purposive
sampling technique based on key actors in Islāmic banks.",2
"The key
actors are those having direct or indirect influence on the Sharīʿah risk
112 International Journal of Economics, Management and Accounting 30, no.",2
"The rationale of using the interview method is to find
out what was on interviewees’ minds, what they thought, and how they
felt about a certain issue.",2
"Since interview is one method of obtaining
primary data, face to face interviews were to be engaged (Creswell,
2014).",2
"The study concentrated on four selected Islāmic banks in
Malaysia.",2
"The interviews were conducted with the Head of Sharīʿah
and Head of Sharīʿah risk management in the four selected Islāmic
banks to understand their current Sharīʿah risk management practices.",2
"They have been involved directly in managing Sharīʿah non-
compliance risks in Islāmic banks.",2
"Based on the Shariah Governance
Policy Document (2019), the function of Head of Research is to
provide day-to-day advice to relevant parties within IFIs on Sharīʿah
matters based on the rulings of the SAC and decisions or advice of the
Sharīʿah committee and for Head of Sharīʿah Risk Management is to
systematically identify, measure, monitor and report Sharīʿah non-
compliance risks in the operations, business, affairs and activities of
IFIs, in this case Islāmic banks.",2
"Therefore, they are the best
interviewees to be interviewed for this study.",2
"In this study, written open-ended questions were prepared for
the interviewees in a structured interview.",2
"The structured interview
procedure protocol is important to be able to ask specific objective
questions in an arranged order.",2
"Moreover, in line with the objective of
the study, the open-ended questions were well structured and were
asked to all interviewees to facilitate faster interviews that can be more
easily analyzed and compared.",2
"This process encouraged the
interviewees to respond to the questions as accurately as possible.",2
"The focus of the interview is to gain in-depth understanding
of the existing Sharīʿah risk management practice in Malaysian
Islāmic banks.",2
"In order to develop the interview questions, the review
of the existing Sharīʿah risk management guideline issued by Bank
Negara Malaysia and also the previous literature related to Sharīʿah
risk management practice in Islāmic banks are used.",2
"The length of the
interview is approximately one hour for each interviewee.",2
"The data
gathered from interview were transcribed and summarized according
to categories, namely risk identification, risk measurement, risk
monitoring and controlling, and risk reporting.",2
"In general, the data
analysis intends to interpret text and image by way of data
segmentation (Creswell, 2014).",2
"Creswell (2013) contended that data
collection and data analysis must be done simultaneously in
qualitative research.",2
"The information was then analyzed and
interpreted following the objectives of the study.",2
"Shariah Risk Management Practices in Malaysian Islāmic Banks 113
4.",2
"FINDINGS
4.1 RISK IDENTIFICATION
Risk identification is mainly driven by the necessity to know the
potential risks encountered by the organization from different
processes and other potential sources.",2
"Benchmarks for identifying
Sharīʿah non-compliance risk come from the rulings and decisions of
the Sharīʿah Advisory Council of Bank Negara Malaysia, rulings and
decisions of the Sharīʿah Committee of Islāmic banks and guidelines
issued by Bank Negara Malaysia, for example Sharīʿah parameters.",2
"Consequently, the interview mainly sought to understand risk
identification process for Sharīʿah non-compliance risk and to
ascertain the stage at which the risk is triggered, with a focus on
Business Units, Sharīʿah review, Sharīʿah audit, and regulatory
inspections.",2
"The findings indicated similar risk identification practices
in three of the four participating banks.",2
"In general, all interviewees agreed that the most important
process of Sharīʿah risk management is risk identification, as it relates
to the process of understanding the nature and impact of the risk on
the institution’s current and future operations.",2
"The main purpose of the
risk identification process is to identify the main causal factors
contributing to incidents of non-compliance.",2
"Risk Control Self-Assessment (RCSA) was found to be the
common tool for risk identification, while the first stage for triggering
Sharīʿah non-compliance risk differs among Islāmic banks.",2
"The
RCSA is a useful self-assessment tool for identifying possible
breaches of Sharīʿah parameters within the end-to-end process of each
function.",2
"Accordingly, the interview findings showed that the
responsibility to identify and assess Sharīʿah non-compliance risk is
borne by the respective process (risk) owners.",2
"For instance, in Bank
A, the interviewee noted that “the most critical part is the functional
unit itself, which owns the Sharīʿah non-compliance risk and
responsible to identify the risk.” This further necessitated deployment
of a Risk Controller at each functional unit and branch.",2
"Similar
function was found in Bank C, with designations including Designated
Compliance and Risk Officer (DCRO) and Risk Control Officer
(RCO) for every business unit.",2
The DCRO subordinates the RCO.,2
"Interestingly, “one of their Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) is self-
identifying the breaches.",1
"The more they identify, the better their
KPIs,” the interviewee from Bank C disclosed.",2
"As for Bank D, the
interviewee informed that, “the respective risk officer must identify
114 International Journal of Economics, Management and Accounting 30, no.",2
"1 (2022)
and highlight the issue to the respective authority.” Therefore, it can
be noted that identifying the Sharīʿah non-compliance risk rests on the
process owners and officers within functional units.",2
"Consequent to RCSA practices, Business Units were found in
three banks to be the first predominant triggering process for Sharīʿah
non-compliance risk.",2
"In general, in both Banks A and C, the Business
Unit is deemed as the first line of defense in identifying Sharīʿah non-
compliance risk, while the Sharīʿah Review and Sharīʿah Audit are
regarded the second and third line of defense, respectively, in
improving identification of Sharīʿah non-compliance risk of the
Business Units.",2
"For instance, the interviewee for Bank A emphasized
that “when the second and third line of defense come, it is just to
complete what has been done by the first line of defense (Business
Units).” The interviewee further explained that in most cases, it is
difficult for the Sharīʿah Review and Sharīʿah Audit to find any
undetected Sharīʿah non-compliance risk due to the effectiveness of
the Business Unit’s risk identification process.",2
"Business Units include
all units in Islāmic banks, for example finance, marketing, product,
recovery and disbursement.",2
"Thus, there is minimal possibility that the
other processes (lines of defense) will identify Sharīʿah non-
compliance risk.",2
"In this regard, the interviewee from Bank D affirmed
that “the chance is very minimal, though it is possible if the Sharīʿah
non-compliance risk is not identified.” Nevertheless, the interviewee
from Bank C argued that the second and third lines of defense are
important as there is a possibility that the “Business Units will
overlook some of the risks”.",2
"In contrast, Sharīʿah review is the first process which triggers
Sharīʿah non-compliance risk in Bank B.",2
"In this bank, “basically, we
trigger the Sharīʿah non-compliance risk during our Sharīʿah review
or Sharīʿah audit,” noted the interviewee.",2
"The indication here is that
the Sharīʿah Review involves regular review to identify the potential
Sharīʿah non-compliance risk for safeguarding measures to be
instituted.",2
"Consequently, the Business Units detect no risk of Sharīʿah
non-compliance during or post implementation of contracts, products,
and procedures.",2
"The interviewee testified that:
“When the implementation starts, Business Units will not
detect the risk anymore because they implement based on
the Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) approved by
various committees.",2
"So normally, we detect the Sharīʿah
non-compliance risk when we conduct the Sharīʿah
Review.”
Shariah Risk Management Practices in Malaysian Islāmic Banks 115
The above indicates that the Business Units’ process will not
trigger the Sharīʿah non-compliance risk due to the implementation of
approved SOPs.",2
"This is possible where the RCSA is either not placed
or applied effectively.",2
"One of the key secondary findings is that, since
the RCSA places responsibility to risk owners, the respective staff
must have Sharīʿah knowledge to be able to identify the Sharīʿah non-
compliance risk.",2
"In case of doubt, they require the support from
dedicated Sharīʿah risk management functions in Islāmic banks.",2
"For Bank D, in general, a Sharīʿah compliance governance
requirement was incorporated in all of the bank’s procedures and
manuals.",2
"For triggering Sharīʿah non-compliance risk, the respective
officers must highlight the issue to the respective authority.",2
"The
respective authority must be notified immediately when the risk
triggers.",2
"From this, based on the existing internal process and Bank
Negara Malaysia’s requirement, the responsibility is clear.",2
"All
Sharīʿah non-compliance occurrences, upon discovery, are regarded
as potential Sharīʿah non-compliance and must be discussed in the
Sharīʿah Committee meeting.",2
"Essentially, Islāmic banks follow the
guidelines issued by Bank Negara Malaysia.",2
"If there is any Sharīʿah
non-compliance occurrence, the respective staff needs to bring the
issue to the Sharīʿah committee.",2
"All the relevant functions must obtain
the decision from the Sharīʿah committee, regardless of whether a
potential Sharīʿah non-compliance event becomes an actual Sharīʿah
non-compliance event.",2
"To conclude, from the interview, all interviewees agreed that
the Sharīʿah risk management is part of the operational risk
management.",2
"Therefore, the methodology, including risk
identification, measurement, monitoring, and others, is embedded in
the operational risk framework.",2
"In risk identification, the course of
identifying could occur at the first line of defense (risk owner), the
second line of defense (Sharīʿah risk management and Sharīʿah
review), and the third line of defense (Sharīʿah audit).",2
"The best-case
scenario is when the Sharīʿah non-compliance risk is identified at the
first line of defense, which will create an effective management of
Sharīʿah non-compliance risk.",2
"However, there is a possibility for the Business Units (risk
owners) to overlook a Sharīʿah non-compliance risk event; yet the
Sharīʿah review or Sharīʿah audit would be able to identify the issue.",2
"The chance that the Sharīʿah review, Sharīʿah audit, and Bank Negara
Malaysia would come to identify similar issues as those of the business
unit is very minimal.",2
"This could happen if they had performed the
work at the same time and/or the issue was still not resolved.",2
"If the
116 International Journal of Economics, Management and Accounting 30, no.",2
"1 (2022)
issue was resolved, the bank would normally make all the
rectifications.",2
"4.2 RISK MEASUREMENT
Risk measurement is the evaluation of the tendency that Sharīʿah non-
compliance risk will have an impact on Islāmic banks.",2
"Therefore, the
interview was conducted to identify the tools that Islāmic banks use to
measure the Sharīʿah non-compliance risk.",2
"The findings affirmed that
RCSA is the predominant tool for measuring the Sharīʿah non-
compliance risk.",2
"This is not surprising as it appears to be the main risk
management tool for Islāmic banks, as demonstrated in the earlier
section.",2
"The findings further revealed that there is no detailed
guideline for the specific measurement of Sharīʿah non-compliance
risk.",2
"Consequently, the banks utilize risk management tools
commonly used for conventional operational risk management in
developing their guidelines.",2
"Only Bank D has not developed a
guideline for the Sharīʿah non-compliance risk’s RCSA.",2
"For instance,
the interviewee of Bank A stated that “we have a detailed guideline.",2
"RCSA also has its own guideline and manual.” Based on their
respective guidelines, some Islāmic banks classify the Sharīʿah non-
compliance risk as ‘major,’ ‘moderate,’ and ‘low’ while others use
‘severe,’ ‘medium,’ and ‘tolerable.’ For example, the Sharīʿah non-
compliance risk will be classified as ‘severe’ if the event of non-
compliance leads to contract invalidation or income derecognition.",2
"The middle risk category (medium) refers to a situation where the
aqad requirements are not fulfilled.",2
"The tolerable risk applies to
incidents which do not give rise to the effects of severe and medium
risks.",2
The banks’ appetite primarily drives the risk ratings.,2
"Uniformly, the impact of the Sharīʿah non-compliance risk is
categorized as either financial or non-financial.",2
"In the case of the
former, it is channelled to charitable organizations.",0
"For Bank B, there
is also a combination of tasks between Sharīʿah department and
Finance department.",2
"This is because the Finance department is
responsible for the financial part.",2
"If the Sharīʿah non-compliance event
leads to a financial impact, the income generated will be derecognized
and channelled to charitable organizations or returned to the original
owner.",0
"The Sharīʿah Committee must ensure that this action is done
by the Finance department with the help of Sharīʿah department.",2
"In
addition, this will be included in the Sharīʿah Committee Report of
Islāmic banks.",2
"Shariah Risk Management Practices in Malaysian Islāmic Banks 117
In the absence of a guideline, all the banks, except Bank D,
have called for a detailed guideline for measurement of Sharīʿah non-
compliance risk.",2
"According to the interviewee of Bank D, Sharīʿah
non-compliance risk is subjective.",2
"He said that “basically, this matter
Sharīʿah non-compliance risk measurement is really subjective.",2
"As a
result, we do not have a clear methodology.” Nevertheless, the
methodology for the Sharīʿah non-compliance risk rating exists.",2
"The
interviewee explained that:
“The bank does not have a clear methodology.",2
"However,
similar to Sharīʿah review, the bank has its own risk rating.",2
"For Sharīʿah non-compliance risk, the methodology for
risk rating is based on whether there is a breach of Sharīʿah
requirement or not, as resolved by Sharīʿah committee and
whether the contract is null and void.”
The implication of the above quote is in contrast with Bank A,
which has a detailed and well-defined methodology.",2
"In Bank A, the
process is very structured with a clearly defined Sharīʿah non-
compliance risk rating.",2
"Generally, the findings suggested that
measuring the possibility and impact of the Sharīʿah non-compliance
risk differs among banks, aggravated by the lack of a comprehensive
regulatory guideline.",2
"However, if an Islāmic bank is able to have its
own comprehensive guideline, in the absence of regulatory guideline
to measure the impact of the Sharīʿah non-compliance risk and
approved by its Sharīʿah committee, this can assist in measuring the
Sharīʿah non-compliance risk in a more systematic manner.",2
"4.3 RISK MONITORING AND CONTROLLING
The next stage in the risk management process deals with risk
monitoring and controlling.",2
"Risk monitoring can be used to ensure that
risk management practices are sound and effective.",2
"Proper and
effective risk monitoring also helps Islāmic banks to discover mistakes
at an early stage rather than suffering the bad consequences from
dormant untraceable risks.",2
"The risk monitoring mechanism must
monitor the variables and factors that can lead to Sharīʿah non-
compliance risk.",2
"The monitoring process utilizes data collected from
the previous audit or inspection.",2
"Risk monitoring can be used to ensure Islāmic banks shall
have in place effective structures to monitor, control and report
Sharīʿah non-compliance risks in their activities.",2
"Based on the
118 International Journal of Economics, Management and Accounting 30, no.",2
"1 (2022)
interview findings, one of the tools used in risk monitoring is Key Risk
Indicators (KRIs).",2
"According to the BNM Operational Risk Integrated
Online Network (ORION), KRIs refer to information that will provide
insight into the operational risk exposure including Sharīʿah non-
compliance risk and are used to monitor the main drivers of exposure
associated with the key risks.",2
"KRIs can be utilized to measure the
actual value of the cause and effect resulting from Sharīʿah non-
compliance events.",2
"KRIs will predict potential Sharīʿah non-
compliance events, allowing Islāmic banks to take reasonable
preventive and corrective actions to avoid any losses resulting from
such non-compliance events.",2
"KRIs are mostly quantitative indicators
used to provide insight into operational risk exposures and controls.",2
"The interview findings indicated that all interviewees agreed
on the importance of KRIs in risk monitoring and controlling of
Sharīʿah non-compliance risk.",2
"According to the interviewee from
Bank A:
“Chief Risk Officer is responsible to provide leadership to
ensure that all risk is monitored and controlled.",2
"In order
for Chief Risk Officer to discharge the responsibilities to
highlight key risks, including Sharīʿah non-compliance
risk, he needs to ensure functional area which own the risk
to identify the risk, risk officers to monitor and control the
risk using KRIs.”
4.4 RISK REPORTING
Generally, in the case of Sharīʿah non-compliance risk, the reporting
is required so that a comprehensive overview of risks can be obtained.",2
"Bank Negara Malaysia has specified the reporting requirements in its
ORION.",2
"All Islāmic banking institutions must submit both potential
and actual Sharīʿah non-compliance occurrences through the ORION.",2
"Nonetheless, the ORION describes a potential Sharīʿah non-
compliance occurrence as any Sharīʿah non-compliance event
distinguished and corroborated by only an officer within the control
function; it defines the actual Sharīʿah non-compliance occurrence as
any potential Sharīʿah non-compliance event that has been
substantiated by Islāmic banks’ Sharīʿah Committee.",2
"A potential Sharīʿah non-compliance event must be reported
in the ORION within one working day upon confirmation by an officer
within the Sharīʿah control function.",2
"It must be tabled at the Islāmic
bank’s Sharīʿah Committee meeting within 14 working days for a
Shariah Risk Management Practices in Malaysian Islāmic Banks 119
decision.",2
"If the Sharīʿah Committee deduces it as an actual Sharīʿah
non-compliance event, it must be reported within one working day.",2
"Subsequently, a rectification plan must be completed within 30
calendar days from the reporting date of the actual Sharīʿah non-
compliance event.",2
"Islāmic bank’s Sharīʿah Committee and Board of
Directors must approve the plan before submission.",2
"Finally, Islāmic
banks are required to monitor or follow up, to ensure that actual
Sharīʿah non-compliance events are resolved with appropriate control
mechanisms established to avoid recurrences.",2
"Such actions must be
updated accordingly in the ORION.",2
"In line with the regulatory requirements, this study aimed at
ascertaining the extent that Islāmic banks follow the ORION policy
document requirements.",2
"The interview findings indicated similar
practices for all Islāmic banks under study.",2
"For instance, the
interviewee from Bank B explained that the bank follows the time
frame given by Bank Negara Malaysia.",2
"He said that:
“There is a time frame.",2
"When we find the issue of Sharīʿah
non-compliance events, we need to key-in in the ORION
and submit to Bank Negara Malaysia.",2
"During that time, we
only identify the potential Sharīʿah non-compliance risk.",2
"After confirmation by the Sharīʿah Committee, we need to
resolve this issue within a certain period.",2
"We need to
submit our report and rectification plan to the Sharīʿah
Committee and the Board for endorsement.",2
"Lastly, we
submit to Bank Negara Malaysia.”
Based on the practice by Bank D, the interviewee described
that they need to immediately notify the exact time of becoming aware
of the risks, as required by their internal process and guided by Bank
Negara Malaysia’s ORION requirement.",2
"An officer within the
Sharīʿah control function is responsible to confirm if there is any
potential issue.",2
"Basically, the Sharīʿah Committee may delegate one
respective officer for such duties.",2
"Actual confirmation of Sharīʿah
non-compliance events is done by the Sharīʿah Committee.",2
"CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATIONS
This study was expected to provide some empirical evidence on the
Sharīʿah risk management practices in mitigating Sharīʿah non-
compliance risk from the Sharīʿah review and Sharīʿah audit
functions.",2
"Overall, the findings confirmed that all Islāmic banks in this
120 International Journal of Economics, Management and Accounting 30, no.",2
"1 (2022)
study do have a good Sharīʿah risk management practice.",2
"Islāmic
banks must certify that the Sharīʿah risk management procedures are
efficient and effective, and that a similar risk management process is
applied to the risk management of other non-specific risks, such as
credit risk and market risk, which can be used as long as Sharīʿah
principles are adhered to.",2
"The only exception to the above relates to
the way Islāmic banks measure Sharīʿah non-compliance risk.",2
"As a general suggestion, it is mainly essential to ensure the
effectiveness of all three lines of defense, which are the Business Unit,
the Sharīʿah review, the Sharīʿah risk management and Sharīʿah
audit, so that the public is confident that Islāmic banking institutions’
business operations and activities always conform to Sharīʿah
principles.",2
"However, there is a need to have a comprehensive Sharīʿah
risk management framework for respective Islāmic banks so that the
practices are consistently used in the banks and can assist the Sharīʿah
audit to conduct risk-based audit.",2
"This is in line with the institutional
theory that Sharīʿah risk management that argued the existence of
standard set of rules is mandatory to formulate an efficient risk
management structure which can be achieved through the process
widely accepted by Islāmic banks.",2
"The Sharīʿah non-compliance risk
manual will be particularly useful as a reference by Sharīʿah review
and Sharīʿah audit officers in performing their tasks.",2
"In addition, Bank
Negara Malaysia should play a role by issuing guidelines on Sharīʿah
risk management as a guidance by Islāmic banks in Malaysia, which
is consistent with the contingency theory that confirmed the
implementation of risk management practices depends upon
environment, namely the guidelines issued by the regulator.",2
"The
officers involved with the Sharīʿah risk management are accountable
for overseeing the effectiveness of Sharīʿah risk management and the
day-to-day management of the Sharīʿah non-compliance risk in
Islāmic banking institutions.",2
"In addition, risk officers who perform the
Sharīʿah risk management function must possess the requisite
knowledge on Sharīʿah requirements applicable to Islāmic financial
businesses (Shariah Governance Policy Document, 2019).",2
