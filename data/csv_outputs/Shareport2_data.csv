Abstract: Shariah compliance is the backbone of Islamic banks."
"As
an institution established within the ambit of Shariah, Islamic banks
are expected to ensure that their aims, activities, operations and
1
UUMJLS 8, 1-15 (2017)
management adhere to the Shariah principles and values."
"Failure
to comply with Shariah, will expose Islamic Financial Institutions
(IFIs) to Shariah non-compliance risk."
"Subsequently, it is an
essential duty of the IFIs to manage Shariah risk properly."
"In order
to effectively manage the risk vulnerability of the IFIs, proper
measures for risk management have been put in place in different
frameworks that are either domestic or international based."
"In the
Malaysian context, IFIs are guided by relevant regulations such as
the Shariah Governance Framework 2010, IFSB principles and
Islamic Financial Services Act 2013 with regards to Shariah risk
management."
"This research examined the regulatory requirements
of the Shariah risk management process for Islamic financial
institutions that operate in Malaysia, in the context of the Guidelines
on Shariah Governance Framework 2010 issued by the Central Bank
of Malaysia."
"The paper discusses the concept of “risk”, “Shariah
risk” and “Shariah non-compliant risk” in the context of Islamic
Financial Institutions and also examines the process adopted by the
Malaysian IFIs in managing the Shariah risk."
"The hypotheses that
the paper seeks to establish are that there are differences between
the concept of Shariah risk and Shariah non-compliant risk; and
that the Shariah risk management process adopted by the IFIs are
different than the conventional risk management process due to the
unique features and requirements of the IFIs."
"Keywords: Shariah, Risk management, Islamic Financial
Institutions."
Abstrak: Pematuhan Syariah adalah tulang belakang bank Islam.
"Sebagai sebuah institusi yang ditubuhkan dalam bidang Syariah, bank
Islam dijangka memastikan bahawa matlamat, aktiviti, operasi dan
pengurusan mereka mematuhi prinsip dan nilai Syariah."
"Kegagalan
mematuhi Syariah, akan mendedahkan Institusi Kewangan Islam
(IFIs) kepada risiko ketidakpatuhan Syariah."
"Selepas itu, adalah
tanggungjawab penting IFI untuk menguruskan risiko Syariah
dengan betul."
"Untuk mengatasi kelemahan risiko IFI secara
berkesan, langkah-langkah yang sewajarnya untuk pengurusan
risiko telah dilaksanakan dalam rangka kerja yang berbeza sama
ada di dalam negeri atau antarabangsa."
"Dalam konteks Malaysia,
IFI dipandu oleh peraturan yang berkaitan seperti Rangka Kerja
Tadbir Urus Syariah 2010, prinsip IFSB dan Akta Perkhidmatan
Kewangan Islam 2013 berkaitan dengan pengurusan risiko Syariah."

"Makalah ini membincangkan konsep “risiko”, “risiko Syariah” dan
“risiko tidak patuh Syariah” dalam konteks Institusi Kewangan Islam
dan juga mengkaji proses yang diterima pakai oleh IFI Malaysia
dalam menguruskan risiko Syariah."
"Hipotesis ini bertujuan untuk
melihat perbezaan antara konsep risiko Syariah dengan risiko tidak
patuh Syariah; dan proses pengurusan risiko Syariah yang diterima
pakai oleh IFIs adalah berbeza daripada proses pengurusan risiko
konvensional disebabkan oleh ciri-ciri unik dan keperluan IFI."
"Kata kunci: Syariah, Pengurusan risiko, Institusi Kewangan Islam."
"INTRODUCTION
It is an undeniable fact that IFIs face more types of risk than their
conventional counterparts."
"The IFIs have to bear all sorts of risk that
are faced by conventional banks."
"In addition to that, the requirement
of Shariah compliance places another burden on the IFIs to ensure
all their its activities and operations comply with Shariah rules and
precepts."
This fact can be seen in the light of the risk exposure of IFIs.
"The IFIs are exposed to all kinds of risk faced by the conventional
banks such as credit risk, market risk, liquidity risk and operational
risk."
"However, the list of risk exposure for IFIs does not stop there
since the IFIs face some other unique risks relating to the failure to
adhere to Shariah principles in their businesses and operations."
"SHARIAH RISK IN IFIS
Most literature equate Shariah risk to Shariah non-compliance risk."
"Both terms refer to same meaning that relates to the risk that will
arise due to the violation of Shariah rules or rulings made by the
regulator."
"On the other hand, the IFSB-1 considers Shariah non-
compliance risk as a subset of operational risk.1 According to Balz,
Shariah risk can be regarded as “the chance that an Islamic financial
transaction is challenged on the grounds that it does not comply with
1 See IFSB 1 (2005) on discussion about Operational risk, 39
3
UUMJLS 8, 1-15 (2017)
Islamic Law”.2 In conventional banking, the law plays a vital role in
ensuring that the contract will be enforceable in court."
"However, the
position is different in Islamic banking because Shariah principles
are regarded and viewed as a risk which enables the parties to
challenge the validity of the contract on the basis that it does not
conform to the Islamic legal principle."
"Karim Ginena defines Shariah risk as “the risk of financial losses
that IFI may experience as a result of non-compliance with Shariah
precepts in activities, as ascertained by the SSB or pertinent
authority in the relevant jurisdiction”3 Apart from that, in some
literature, the Shariah non-compliance risk is associated with the
divergence of opinion among the scholars on the nature and validity
of the financial transactions and products.4 De Lorenzo addressed
this issue by introducing a term ‘fatwa risk’ to describe the risk that
originates from the differences of fatwa among the scholars.5 Fatwa
risk is perceived as one type of risk since Shariah rulings which are
solely based on one madzhab will not be accepted globally.6
Kamal Abdel Karim and Hassan Yusuf asserted that Shariah non-
compliance risk can take place at different stages of the operations
and activities of the IFIs.7The risk in each stage may lead to different
consequences."
"Firstly, the risk may occur when the contract contains
some elements of interest, gambling or uncertainty."
"Secondly, the
area of the formulation and implementation mechanism of the
product may also be prone to Shariah non-compliance risk."
"Thirdly,
the risk may emerge when the process of the structured product is
not implemented as advised by the board."
"This scenario takes place
when the management of the IFI adds or deletes some processes

which were not initially presented to the Shariah board during the
approval."
"The last category relates to the differences of opinion
among the scholars in the interpretation of the Shariah principles."
"The product may be declared null and void by other scholars or
regulatory bodies due to the defects in product formulation or the
differences in the interpretation of the Shariah principles, procedures
and processes."
"This study suggests that Shariah risk should be defined as the
weaknesses in the overall Shari’ah control processes which may
lead to events that adversely impact IFIs."
"It covers the end – to– end
process from Shariah decision–making stages to the implementation
of the decision and also the occurrence of Shariah non-compliance
events due to lapses or failures in the processes, people, system and
external facts or circumstances."
"SHARIAH RISK MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK
The Oxford Dictionary for Business defines risk management as
“a process that aims to help organizations to understand, evaluate,
and take actions on all their risk.8 Similarly, risk management can
be defined as “the process by which managers satisfy the need
to manage Bank’s risk exposure by identifying key risk factors;
obtaining consistent, understandable, operational risk measures;
choosing which risk to reduce, and which to increase and by what
means; and establishing procedures to monitor the resulting risk
positions.9 Basel Committee for Banking Supervision (2001) defines
financial risk management as a sequence of four processes:
(1) The identification of events into one or more broad categories
of market, credit, operational and other risks into specific sub-
categories;
(2) The measurement and assessment of risks using data and risk
model;
(3) The monitoring and reporting of the risk assessments on a
timely basis; and
(4) The control of these risks by senior management."

UUMJLS 8, 1-15 (2017)
An identical definition for risk management was provided under
IFSB 1 (2005) where risk management was defined as a process that
consists of risk identification, measurement, mitigation, monitoring,
reporting and control."
"On the other hand, Shariah Governance
Framework defines Shariah risk management as “a function that
consists of identifying, measuring, monitoring and controlling the
Shariah non-compliance risks in order to mitigate the risks arising
from non-compliance events”.10 The Shariah risk management must
be systematic to enable the bank to have an effective business and
activities without being exposed to unacceptable risks.11
Thus, apart from credit, market, liquidity and operational risk
management, Shariah risk management control function must form
one of the parts in IFI’s integrated risk management framework.12
This technical and complex function requires qualified or
experienced risk management officers who have good Shariah
knowledge to effectively perform such function.13 The Shariah non-
compliance risk management function as outlined by the SGF in
summary involves the following14:
i."
"Facilitating the process of identifying, measuring, controlling
and monitoring Shariah non-compliance risks inherent in the
IFI’s operation."
"Formulating and recommending appropriate Shariah non-
compliance risk management practices and guidelines; and
iii."
"Developing and implementing processes for Shariah non-
compliance risk awareness in the IFI."
"The first function mentioned in the above paragraph generally
involves a flow of process."
"The process flow of such structure begins
with the identification of the potential Shariah non-compliance risk,
followed by assessment and measurement of the risk."

"The people mentioned

above are the people that are responsible in the management of IFIs."
"Any weaknesses or shortcomings arising from lack of qualified
personnel to carry out the task in maintaining the compliance with
Shariah in all activities and operations of IFIs are the risk that need
to be properly managed."
"Thus, it is incumbent on the management
of IFI to provide comprehensive training and also to establish an
efficient standard operating procedure and policies within the IFI to
reduce the occurrence of mistakes and negligence among the staffs."
"The enrichment of human capital in the IFI will definitely reduce
the occurrences of mistakes by the staffs in the commission of their
tasks.17

Process is another risk factor that needs to be managed by the IFIs."
"Process in this context refers to the process involved in product
development adopted in the operation of IFIs either the pre-product
approval, i.e."
"process of product structuring and developing prior
to introduction to the market as well as the post-product approval
process, i.e."
"process after the product has been offered to the
customers and transactions have been carried out).18 The process
adopted in the pre-product approval involves the issuance of Shari’ah
decisions, product structuring, vetting of contracts and agreements
as well as compliance checks before the product is offered to the
customers."
"On the other hand, the process involved in the post-
product approval includes Shariah audit and Shariah review that are
conducted to ensure compliance with Shariah in the implementation
of every product offered to the customers."
"Shariah non-compliance
risk may occur during these processes due to unclear processes,
policies, procedures, or responsibilities; inadequate internal
Shariah governance arrangements; and/or insufficient disclosure
and transparency."
"As such SGF requires that all IFIs shall put in
place the appropriate mechanism to ensure that all key functions
are able to effectively discharge their responsibilities."
"Apart from
that, the board is also expected to perform diligent oversight of the
effective functioning of Shariah governance within IFIs,19 including
the appointment of the Shariah committee.20 The most important
thing that must be established in the mind of each organ working
within the IFI is the effective communication between the organs."
"All organs in the IFI must work together in ensuring adherence to
Shariah in all activities and operations."
"The summary of the factors
contributing to the ineffective process are as follows:
System inefficiency may also expose the IFIs to great risk."
"Information Technology system plays a vital part in the operation
of IFIs."
"It is well known that IFI pledges to ensure all its activities
will be in line with Shariah."
"Similarly, the products offered to the
public must be guaranteed to be in line with Shariah."
"Therefore, the
IT system used by the IFIs must have Shariah compliance status that
is capable of ensuring strict adherence to Shariah in all contracts

"20 Principle 2.3 of SGF

entered into by the IFIs.21 However, most IFIs adopt the IT system
modules that are created for conventional banking and thus are not
suitable for IFIs."
"Inexperienced vendors, non-timely support, non-
user-friendly system, and system mistakes are the most common
factors that expose IFIs to Shariah non-compliant risk."
"In addition to the above factors, there are possible factors that
externally endanger IFIs operation."
"Factors such as lack of
supervision by the regulators and unclear laws and regulations
are the most frequent factors in this category."
"The following table
simplifies the events that can lead to Shariah non-compliance risk:

"Risk Measurement and Assessment
The next step in risk management is the measurement and assessment
of risk."
"This study suggests that Shariah non-compliance risk in the
context of IFIs should be measured according to the status of aqad
or contracts entered into by the IFIs due to the fact that the main
activities of the IFIs are offering specific aqad in the form of financing,

that risk management practices are sound and effective."
"Proper risk
monitoring also helps IFIs to discover mistakes an early stage rather
than suffering the bad consequences from dormant untraceable
risks.26 The risk monitoring mechanism must monitor the variables
and factors that can lead to Shariah non-compliance risk."
"The
monitoring process utilizes data collected from the previous audit
or inspection.27
One of the tools used in risk monitoring is Key Risk Indicator
(KRI)."
"KRI is a mathematical formula that includes all parameters
that describe the operational variation of specific operations within
specific business lines.28 KRI can be used as a tool in measuring the
actual value of the cause and effect arising from non-compliance
events."
"KRI will predict possible occurrences of non-compliance
events to enable the IFIs to take reasonable preventive and corrective
measures to avoid any loss arising from such non-compliance
events."
"Young states that KRIs are mostly quantitative measures
intended to provide insight into operational risk exposures and
control measures.29
For example, on previous occasions, the Shariah non-compliance
risk was discovered from the employees’ mistake and negligence."
"The risk monitoring mechanism will focus on ensuring that a
similar risk will not happen again in the future."
"The risk monitoring
mechanism will check and analyze the sources of the risk to ensure
that the events leading to risk from such factors will not occur again."
"The application of this tool depends heavily on the information and
data that refers to the Key Risk Indicators."
"In the table below, we will provide some examples of KRI to monitor
potential sources of Shariah non-compliance risk."

REGULATORY REQUIREMENT ON REPORTING
The requirement to report to the relevant authority about potential
risks that may take place within IFI is a statutory requirement under
Malaysian law, i.e."
"in Section 28 of the IFSA, whereby failure to
notify the non-compliance with Shariah may render any person
liable to a huge amount of penalty.30 The reporting requirement will
ensure that any weakness or shortcoming within the IFI is properly
disclosed to the relevant authority."
"The Shariah Committee is under
obligation to report any non-compliance with Shariah to the board
30 Section 28(5) provides that failure to report the Shari’ah non-compliance within
the IFI may render a person liable to imprisonment for a term not exceeding
eight years or to a fine not exceeding twenty-five million ringgit or to both."
"12
UUMJLS 8, 1-15 (2017)
to get that matter rectified31."
"If the above step is not sufficient to
cure the non-compliance, then the matter should be brought to the
BNM.32
There are two types of non-compliance events, namely potential and
actual that must be reported."
"When the IFI realizes or suspects that if is
dealing with non-compliance business or activities, the management
of IFI must immediately bring such matter to the attention of the
Shariah committee."
"The Shariah committee shall, upon such report,
deliberate and investigate on such matter to ascertain whether that
the event is potential or actual Shariah non-compliant."
"In the event
the Shariah committee concludes that such event is actual Shariah
non-compliant, then the IFI shall immediately notify the board and
BNM about the matter."
"The immediate rectification plan to cure the
non-compliance must be made made within 30 days from the date
on which the non-compliance event was realized by the IFI."
"On the other hand, if the Shariah committee concludes that the
reported event is a potential Shariah non-compliance, the IFI must
also notify the matter to Bank Negara Malaysia."
"An event will be
considered as potential non-compliance when the Shariah committee
is still deliberating and investigating the matter."
"The event shall
be reported to Bank Negara Malaysia as potential Shariah non-
compliance until a final decision on the matter has been reached
by the Shariah committee."
"The rationale behind the mandatory
reporting obligation for potential non-compliance is to put the IFIs
on the same level playing field in the management of Shariah non-
compliance."
"If the reporting of potential non-compliance is not
obligatory, there is a possibility that many IFIs will treat most of the
non-compliance events as potential to evade the reporting process to
Bank Negara."
"Therefore, the mandatory nature of reporting potential
non-compliance will inculcate a healthy treatment of Shariah
non-compliance in all IFIs in the sense that any non-compliance,
regardless of whether it is actual or potential, must be disclosed
to Bank Negara Malaysia."
"Reports about potential Shariah non-
compliance events shall be made on a monthly basis based on the
calendar year."
"The report must be made to Bank Negara Malaysia
within two weeks after the end of each month."
"We can see that the

32 Principle 3.7 of SGF

timeline for reporting of potential Shariah non-compliance is more
flexible and lenient as compared to the reporting of actual non-
compliance since the IFIs have enough time to deliberate on the
matter."
"CONCLUSION
Shariah risk management is a process that is essential to IFIs as
it facilitates the IFIs to prevent any occurrence of Shariah non-
compliance events that can lead to direct loss as well as indirect
loss."
"The direct loss arising from a Shariah non-compliance risk
may be due to breaches and violations of the terms of the contract
that cause invalidation of the contract."
"In contrast, the legal and
reputational risk is the indirect factor that potentially leads to loss."
"A
legal suit brought against an IFI for Shariah non-compliance in their
operation is an example of indirect loss since the loss is still subject
to the judgement of court."
"Thus, the IFIs are required to ensure that
the process adopted in Shariah risk management is effective and
efficient."
"The IFIs may utilise a similar risk management process as
that applied in the risk management of a conventional bank as long
as they comply with Shariah principles."
"The main exception to the
above assertion relates to the way should be measured Shariah non-
compliance risk."
"This study suggests that measurement of Shariah
non-compliance risk should be made based on the status of aqad."
"This exception relies on the unique feature of Islamic Finance where
every single transaction entered into by the IFIs must be in line with
Shariah to avoid any events that can affect the validity of a contract."
