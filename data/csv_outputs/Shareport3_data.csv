ABSTRACT
The whole process of Shariah compliance in Islamic financial institutions (IFIs) needs adequate attention."
"This is because Shariah non-compliance risk (SNCR) may cause not only unrecognition of income, but also
contribute to the implications on the existing risk profiles."
"The objective of this study is to propose selected
key risk indicators (KRIs) for SNCR."
"At first, it is necessary to review the implications of SNCR on existing
risk profiles in order to examine to what extent the relationship between risks may give some ideas in
determining KRIs for SNCR."
"This study is conducted through a literature review of existing academic
journals, related reports, and statutes."
"The methodology began with addressing the criteria for good KRIs for
risks."
"This study suggests the selected KRIs for SNCR, in the level considered in a stress testing programme
for Shariah risk management."
"This study also suggests several KRIs for SNCR such as number of new
Shariah-related complaints and the amount of impure income as a percentage of total income."
"Overall, this
study has several implications to the Islamic finance industry, and can be a reference for IFIs in structuring
their own comprehensive risk management to enhance the effectiveness of the Shariah governance practice."

"INTRODUCTION
Shariah risk or Shariah non-compliance risk (SNCR) has been the most concerning aspect in
Islamic finance."
"Instead of the first one, most of the studies give better attention to the second
terminology in explaining the meaning."
"Both terminologies are often defined as the risk that
arises from the bank’s failure to comply with rules and principles determined by the relevant
Shariah regulatory councils (IFSB, 2016)."
"In 2010, the regulatory body, Bank Negara Malaysia
(BNM), established the Shariah Governance Framework (2010) to provide a comprehensive
guideline for Islamic banking institutions to deliberate their activities and operations under
Shariah principles."
"This framework has superseded the guidelines on the Governance of Shariah
Committee for the IFIs that regulates the governance of Shariah committee of an IFI in 2004."
"In
2019, BNM has again issued the most recent guideline, the Shariah Governance Policy
Document, which came into force in April 2020 to replace the Shariah Governance Framework
(2010)."
"Thus, it was found that the Shariah risk management is an important Shariah function to
ensure effective risk management of Shariah non-compliance (Ariffin, 2022)."
"Shariah compliance is the core element and the most predominant aspect in the business
operations of the IFIs."
"Failure to adhere to Shariah principles and values in carrying out the
financial activities, business, and operations may lead the IFI to be exposed to the risk of non-
compliance."
"This includes the risk of voidable contracts in IFIs due to non-compliance with
Shariah principles and requirements."
"The other Shariah non-compliance events may include poor
governance, a lack of Shariah-qualified officers, and inadequate control mechanisms (Oz et al.,
2016; Omar & Hassan, 2019)."
"In addition to the financial impact, risk includes non-financial
implications, which affect the image and reputation of IFIs as well as not receive blessings from
Allah SWT."
"Therefore, it is responsible for IFI to ensure that all businesses, operation affairs and
activities are Shariah compliant (Islamic Financial Services Act 2013 (IFSA 2013)."
"If the entire
Shariah compliance process is not given sufficient attention, SNCR may cause not only
unrecognition of income, but also contribute to implications on the existing risk profiles in IFIs
such as credit risk, market risk, reputational risk, and legal and compliance risk (Ginena, 2014;
Ginena & Hamid, 2015; Hassan, 2016; Bhatti, 2019; Ariffin, 2022)."
"Therefore, SNCR needs
effective risk management to minimise the risk exposure that may cause such implications."
"After the financial crisis in 2007 to 2008, stress testing appeared as one of the tools for risk
management practicing among institutions."
"It is a kind of risk mitigation measure begun in 2009
as a means to ensure that U.S. banks had sufficient capital in the wake of the losses from the
2008 financial crisis (Schneider et al., 2023)."
"Since then, more emergence developments and
evolutions have taken place on the stress testing due to some factors such as sophistication of
supervisory stress testing and the increased emphasis of supervisors on the effectiveness of
banks’ own capital planning process."
"In the presence of SNCR, there is little guidance on how to
select and use risk indicators in relation to the risk for the purpose of stress testing."
"It is an area
that has been believed to be particularly challenging for many supervisors in addressing SNCR in
1166
International Journal of Business and Society, Vol."
"3, 2024, 1165-1181
stress testing programmes."
"Hence, there is a need for further guidance in this area."
"As far as
Islamic banking institutions are established, the supervisor (except in Malaysia) does not
consider the SNCR as part of the stress testing programme (IFSB, 2016)."
"Therefore, the present
study attempts to address ideas from the relationship between SNCR and the existing risk profiles
and hence, provides selected key risk indicators (KRIs) for SNCR for the purpose of stress
testing programme."
"Specifically, the objective of this study is to reach a consensus of which and
how many KRIs are good for SNCR."
The rest of this study is organised as follows.
"Section two (below) provides a review of the
implications of SNCR on the existing risk profiles."
"Section three points out the material risks in
relation to operational and Shariah while section four underlies criteria of good KRIs for risk."
"Section five summarises the selecting KRIs for SNCR and section six gives an example of stress
testing in the presence of SNCR."
Section seven then gives some concluding remarks.
"A REVIEW OF SHARIAH NON-COMPLIANCE RISK AND THE EXISTING RISK
PROFILES
Contracts that originate from violations of Islamic law, or Shariah, may be void."
"There will be
far-reaching consequences, such as participant disappointment, financial loss, and potential legal
or regulatory action against the IFIs business (Aziz & Rahman, 2023)."
"Other risks’ incidence and
management are probably going to be impacted as well."
"Besides the unrecognition of income and
the loss incurred by IFIs, SNCR may also give impact to the existing risk profiles."
"The
implications of SNCR on credit risk, market risk, reputational risk, as well as legal and
compliance risk are addressed in the following discussions."
"View 1: SNCR and credit risk
SNCR in IFIs, if not catered well, may reduce the confidence of customers, shareholders,
depositors, and employees as stakeholders."
"This is because they realise that the institution is not
living up to its commitments (IFSB, 2014)."
"This may result in few implications, for example,
customers breaching their financing contracts with the IFI will result in credit risk."
"There might
be three reasons for customer unwilling to meet their obligations and breaching the contract; the
belief that the contract that they entered into has been avoided on Shariah grounds, non-
confidence in the institution’s practices, or the feeling of being betrayed by the institution
(Ginena & Hamid, 2015)."
"If the contract is nullified due to Shariah violations, then this would
lead to the emergence of impermissible income and the exclusion of the corresponding
transaction’s profits from the bank’s income (AAOIFI; Ginena, 2014)."
"Furthermore, breaching
the trust and confidence of investors/depositors can lead to dire consequences, including
withdrawal and insolvency risk (Swartz, 2013)."
"View 2: SNCR and market risk
SNCR may also have an interaction with market risk in some cases."
"For instance, if an IFI owns
investment in stocks and they are found to be non-Shariah compliant for some reasons such as
the debt-to-market capitalisation ratio exceeding 30%, then, the IFI is under an obligation to
liquidate these equities."
"This case may occur at a time when the equities are valued at less than
1167
Nurul Syazwani Mohd Noor, Hamizah Muhammad, Juliana Arifin, Puspa Liza Ghazali
the price of purchase, which leads to losses (Ginena, 2014)."
"While some Shariah supervisory
board members may allow a limited time period for market conditions to improve in order to
minimise the losses, such a period may not be sufficient especially during an economic downturn
(Ginena & Hamid, 2015; Bhatti, 2019)."
"View 3: SNCR and reputational risk
Reputational risk is “the risk arising from negative perception on the part of customers,
counterparties, shareholders, investors or regulators that can adversely affect an IFI’s ability to
maintain existing, or establish new, business relationships, and continued access to sources of
funding.” (IFSB, 2014)."
IFIs’ activities involve the general public to a great extent.
"Therefore,
earning and preserving their trust and confidence is crucial for an institution’s success."
"IFIs
cannot lose their credibility of governing Shariah in their operations and transactions because
such credibility is at the core of their business (Omar & Hassan, 2019; Ginena & Hamid, 2015,
Bhatti, 2019; Hanefah et al., 2020)."
"View 4: SNCR and legal and compliance risk
SNCR can also lead to legal and compliance risk."
"The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision
(BCBS) defines legal risk as “the possibility that lawsuits, adverse judgements or contracts that
turn out to be unenforceable can disrupt or adversely affect the operations or condition of a
bank.” An IFI that claims in its memorandum or/and articles of association that it adheres to the
tenets of Shariah, yet fails to deliver the claims may find itself facing lawsuits from stakeholders
disgruntled with the false advertising."
"It likely shows the non-commitment of the institution to its
claims."
"One of the examples of SNCR leading to legal risk can be seen from the case in the UK,
in which making false statements about provision of services is an offence under the Trade
Descriptions Act of 1968."
"Likewise, making misleading or untrue representations of products or
services in order to make money is an offence under the Fraud Act of 2006."
"Other examples
include uncertainty in interpreting certain Shariah clauses in courts and the possible
unenforceability of Shariah contracts in secular law jurisdictions, which negatively affects market
discipline (DeLorenzo & McMillen, 2007)."
"On the other hand, SNCR can also lead to
compliance risk."
"BCBS defines compliance risk as “the risk of legal or regulatory sanctions, material financial loss,
or loss to reputation a bank may suffer as a result of its failure to comply with laws, regulations,
rules, related self-regulatory organisation standards, and codes of conduct applicable to its
banking activities.” BNM defines compliance risk as “the legal and regulatory risk arising from
noncompliance to legal and regulatory requirements.” For example, an IFI that fails to set up
prudent internal Shariah governance arrangements even though it is required by the regulator to
do so."
"In such cases, the IFI may be fined for its contraventions or even lose its licence to operate."
"In the case of Malaysia, IFSA 2013 requires IFIs to comply with the Shariah principles at all
times."
The relationship between the above-mentioned risks to each other depends on the IFIs.
"Every IFI
shows a different relationship between reputational risk, credit risk, market risk, and legal and
1168
International Journal of Business and Society, Vol."
"3, 2024, 1165-1181
compliance risk (Htay & Salman, 2013)."
"This may be due to the fact that different IFIs may have
a different approach in measuring the risks."
"For many reasons, market and credit risk have often
been treated as if they are unrelated sources of risk; the risk types have been measured separately,
managed separately, and economic capital against each risk type has been assessed separately in
both historical and practical (BCBS, 2009)."
"Based on the above discussions, SNCR as part of
operational risk is found to have significant implications to the risk profiles i.e."
"credit risk,
market risk, reputational risk, and legal and compliance risk."
"Furthermore, SNCR may even result in other various implications to the Islamic banking industry
as a whole such as fund withdrawals, higher costs to attract deposits, direct and indirect financial
losses, liquidity issues, bank runs, bank failure, and financial instability (Ali, 2003; Ginena,
2014)."
"These implications, however, depend on the size of the Islamic banking industry in the
respective country."
"Not only that, it may also tarnish the reputation of the industry, which is
driven by the trust of stakeholders."
"From that, the designed model of the possible implications of
SNCR is illustrated as in Figure 1."

"MATERIAL RISKS IN RELATION TO OPERATIONAL AND SHARIAH
SNCR falls under operational considerations and is relevant to ensure ‘operations are executed in
adherence to the applicable Shariah rules and principles as per the fatwa, policies and procedures
approved by the institutions offering Islamic financial services (IIFS)’s Shariah Board’ (IFSB,
1169
Nurul Syazwani Mohd Noor, Hamizah Muhammad, Juliana Arifin, Puspa Liza Ghazali
2005)."
"Before the KRIs for SNCR are selected, it is necessary to identify matters relating to the
SNCR."
"Therefore, the material risks include the events that result in the risk."
"The loss of income
and asset value may be potentially affected by both the internal and external events."
"An IFI is
influenced by the developments of the external environment in which it is called to operate, as
well as by its internal procedures and processes (Hanefah et al, 2020)."
"Both events may create an
operational risk and SNCR."
"The external events may be created by a wide range of different
events ranging from power failures to floods or earthquakes to terrorist attacks."
"The events can
have a major impact on an IFI."
"Therefore, IFI should be aware that both expected and unexpected
changes to its operations can be major sources of operational risk (Ginena & Hamid, 2015; Bhatti,
2019)."
"It should have in place appropriate arrangements, having regard to the nature, scale, and
complexity of its operation, to ensure that it can continue to function and meet its regulatory
obligations in the event of an unforeseen interruption."
"These arrangements should be regularly
updated and tested to ensure their effectiveness."
"Meanwhile, the internal events may arise due to the failures or inadequacies in any of the IFI’s
people, processes and systems (e.g."
"the information technology, risk management or human
resources management processes and systems), or those of its outsourced service providers."
"Operational risk arising from human resources management may refer to a range of issues such
as mismanaged or poorly trained employees; the potential of employees for negligence, wilful
misconduct; conflict of interests; fraud; and rogue trading (Chaudhury, 2010)."
"Therefore, the
emergence of mistrust, failure to communicate, low morale, and cynicism among staff members,
as well as increased turnover of staff, should be regarded as indicative for potential increase in
operational risk (Abdullah et al., 2011)."
"Operational risk differs from other Islamic banking risks
in that it is typically not directly taken in return for an expected reward, but exists in the natural
course of corporate activity, and this affects the risk management process."
"The internal events
also include legal risk such as exposure to fines, penalties, or punitive damages resulting from
supervisory actions, as well as private settlements (Karimah, 2022)."
"SNCR is one of the risks that
arise due to internal events."
"As a publicly licensed institution and operating as a business entity, Islamic banks including its
directors, management, and staff must operate in compliance with Shariah laws, rules,
regulations, and industry standards."
"Hence, SNCR is also familiar with the risk to earnings or
capital that result from violations or non-conformance with the Shariah rules and principles,
regulations, or prescribed practices, industry practices, or ethical standards determined by the
Shariah supervisory council (IFSB, 2005)."
"The Shariah non-compliance matter has recently
become more significant by being explicitly tied to important Islamic banking legislation, such as
IFSA (2013)."
"Section 28 (3) of the Act sets out clearly the obligations and responsibilities of a
financial institution in the case of Shariah non-compliance, and the subsequent reporting and
disclosure process."
"Compliance violations expose the IFI to regulatory sanction, fines, and civil money penalties."
"For
example, in Malaysia, under Section 245 of the Act, the Central Bank can impose a penalty on
Islamic bank for failing to comply with: any provision of the Act, regulations made under the Act,
any order made, or any direction issued under the Act by the Central Bank or any standards,
condition, restriction, specification, requirement under the Act."
"Penalties and consequences of
not following Shariah non-compliance reporting procedures can be severe."
"Directors and officers
may also be personally liable for compliance failures."
"Compliance violations may result in the
1170
International Journal of Business and Society, Vol."
"3, 2024, 1165-1181
loss of an Islamic bank’s “rating”, causing damaging consequences, such as the loss of its full-
fledged Islamic banking status."
"Since, IFIs deal with the contractual features of a product or services."
"The valid (sahih) contract
arises if: (i) the pillars and conditions of the contract are fulfilled and (ii) establish the legal
implications (for example the transfer of ownership) that Shariah has assigned."
"The contract
becomes invalid (ghayr sahih) if both could not be fulfilled upon the execution."
"The invalid
contract can be divided into irregular (fasid) or void (batil)."
"There are several elements that lead
towards a fasid contract, namely insufficient information with respect to the subject matter (asset),
the price and the delivery time, and the existence of an invalid condition, (for example purchase
undertaking in a mudarabah contract and capital providers are guaranteed of their capital)."
"There
are several forms that a contract becomes batil, which include selling impure items such as pork
and wine; and a sale contract with excessive uncertainty i.e."
"selling something non-existent and
something undeliverable (birds in the sky) (Zuhayli, 1996, 2001; Mansuri, 2006; Ayub, 2007;
Najeeb, 2014)."
"However, there are treatments associated with respective categories of invalid contracts."
"Neither
contracting party can recognise the income realised from the invalid contract."
"Income must be
purified."
"First, if the contract fails to satisfy one or more pillars of the contract."
"The income
should be returned to its owner."
"Second, if the underlying asset employed in the contract is an
item prohibited by Shariah such as wine, pork, and interest."
"The income should be channelled to
public benefit (Dusuki et al., 2012, 2013)."
"It shows that the Shariah non-compliance would affect
the income either it would be returned to its owner or to charity organisation."
"Therefore, SNCR which are considered as part of operational risks affect the capital requirement."
"The treatment of this risk in relation to capital requirements is a new departure that was
introduced in Basel II."
"In applying a capital adequacy framework, the international standards
have used “proxies”, such as gross income or a “business indicator”, to calculate the operational
risk capital charge on the banking industry (Oz et al., 2016)."
"However, the use of gross income as
the basic indicator for operational risk measurement could be misleading in IFIs."
"This is because
a large volume of transactions such as in commodities and the use of structured finance raise
operational exposures that will not be captured by gross income."
"The standardised approach that
allows for different business lines is better suited, but still requires adaptation to the needs of IFIs."
"In particular, SNCR due to the features of the contract, all need to be explicitly considered for
risk measurement."
"Currently, the indicators for SNCR are missing."
"CRITERIA OF GOOD KEY RISK INDICATORS (KRIs)
KRIs are measurable metrics or indicators that track exposure or loss."
"Anything that can perform
the same function can be considered as a risk indicator (Wicaksono & Wijayati, 2023)."
"According to Bank Negara Malaysia (BNM), “Key Risk Indicators” or “KRIs” refer to
information that will provide insight into the operational risk exposure and are used to monitor
the main drivers of exposure associated with the key risks."
"KRIs help in defining the likelihood
of unfavourable situations that could impact an institution’s business continuity (Cernisevs et al.,
2023)."
"There is no consensus about which and how many criteria must be present in order to
1171
Nurul Syazwani Mohd Noor, Hamizah Muhammad, Juliana Arifin, Puspa Liza Ghazali
select the KRIs (Davies et al., 2006; Davies & Haubenstock, 2002; Hoffman, 2002; Finlay, 2004;
Scandizzo, 2005)."
"However, most of the studies believe that the ideal features of KRIs are that
they are effective in tracking the risk, they are comparable within and outside IFI, and they are
practical and easy to use (Mouatassim & Ibenrissoul, 2015)."
"In Europe, Van Den Brink and
Leipoldt (2022) suggest that, to become more relevant, KRIs should be recast as predominantly
business (first line of defence) driven and made practical rather than theoretical."
"KRIs should
have certain characteristics before they can be used as a risk management tool (Young, 2012; Liu,
2023)."
Table 1 provides some criteria for assessing indicators against these three objectives.
"Table 1: Criteria for Good KRIs
Criteria Indicators should
Relevance • relevance to what is being monitored (risk exposure, control effectiveness
indicators and measure performance)."
• be linked to an IFI’s SNCR.
"• be able to provide management with both a quantum as to current levels of
exposure and the degree to which such exposures are changing over time."
"Comparable • be numbers or counts (number of days, employees, etc."
"), monetary values,
percentages, ratios, time duration or a value from some pre-defined rating
set (such as that used by a credit rating agency), monitor risk."
• be comparable over time.
• be reported with primary values.
• be meaningful without interpretation to some more subjective measure.
"Predictable • be able to provide a leading, lagging, or current perspective of an IFI’s
SNCR exposure."
"Easy to • reflect two characteristics – (i) data used for the indicator should be simple
Monitor and relatively cost effective to collect and quantify; (ii) assure and distribute
- data should be relatively easy to interpret, understand and monitor."
Auditable • be easy to understand and use.
• sources of indicators should be properly documented.

(2006); Mouatassim & Ibenrissoul (2015); Hassan et al.
"(2017);
Ariffin (2022); Liu (2023)
However, each criteria is believed to have its own shortcoming."
"First, the relevance of an
indicator is the relevance that can change over time and can also change when there is an
emergence of new and existing exposures, whether they are mitigated or no longer cause a
consequence."
"One technique that can be used to check and maintain the relevance of selected
indicators is to link updates to the indicator programme with the completion of risk and control
self-assessments, drawing on the experience, knowledge and understanding that IFI’s business
entities/areas (such as business units and functions, Shariah control function, management,
Shariah committee, board and other parties) have of their SNCR exposures and associated
indicators."
"In this manner, it may be useful to think of potential indicators from the following
perspectives: Does it help identify existing risks?"
Does it help quantify or measure the risk?
"Does
it help monitor the exposure?"
Does it help manage the exposure and its consequences?
"The roles of different IFI’s business entities/areas or individuals within the IFI should also be
taken into consideration when determining relevance."
"In many cases, the business entity/area that
1172
International Journal of Business and Society, Vol."
"3, 2024, 1165-1181
can provide data for some specific indicator may have a different perspective on associated
SNCR exposures to those business entities that use the data for exposure monitoring purposes in
which the relevance of the indicator and its data over time should focus on the following errors or
factor."
"(i) Operational error, which refers to an operational error in the offering of a Shariah
compliant product that invalidates the Shariah contract being used for the product."
"Among the
potential causes of operational error could be: lack of Shariah understanding; lack of Shariah
related operational guidelines; system issues/errors; and human error; (ii) Documentation error,
which refers to an error in the documentation of a Shariah compliant product that invalidates the
Shariah contract being used for the product."
"Among the potential causes of documentation error
are: failure to comply with the specific Shariah pre-requisites for a valid contract or transaction;
and the existence of non-Shariah compliant term(s) in the relevant documents that may invalidate
the transaction; (iii) External factor, which refers to an external factor, for example on impure
income for Securities and Fund Services (SFS)’s institutional clients."
"It happens when certain
securities belonging to the clients that were initially Shariah compliant, have been re-classified as
Shariah non-compliant."
"As a result, the income from those particular securities is considered as
impure income and will be channelled to charity."
"Second, when implementing a new indicator, the measurement technique should be agreed
amongst the stakeholders to ensure that everyone agrees with what the value represents, how it is
calculated, what is included or excluded, and how variances in the values will be handled."
"Third, indicators can provide a leading, lagging, or current perspective of an IFI’s SNCR
exposure."
"However, it is important to bear in mind that the indicator data collection process itself
almost invariably implies a historical perspective – by the time the data is collected, quality
assured and distributed, time has elapsed, and hence the data is “lagging”."
"In reality, many
indicators are both lagging and current."
"For example, the number of unresolved customer
complaints in which such complaints relate to issues that have already occurred (the lagging
aspect), but still needs to be addressed (the current aspect)."
"Lagging and current indicators can
also have a leading element to them that may need to be considered."
"In the case of unresolved
customer complaints, an IFI’s failure to address these could give rise to a costly lawsuit at some
point in the future and or bad publicity, leading to reduced sales."
"Truly leading indicators are rare and are usually related to causal drivers within the business
environment within which the IFI operates; they tend to be measures of the state of people,
process, technology and the market that affects the level of risk in a particular IFI."
"A leading or
preventative indicator can be something as simple as the number of limit breaches on market or
risk exposures, or cash movements, or the average length of delays in executing particular
activities."
"In themselves, such occurrences may not be loss events in their own right, but if their
value starts to increase this may point to the potential for a higher frequency or severity of
operational loss events."
"In the case of fully predictive indicators, which predict what is going to
happen, rather than simply infer that something is changing, single indicators by themselves are
of little use, as they need context in order to become predictive."
"Fourth, a crucial aspect relating to the data collection process is quality assurance."
"The
collection cycle needs to incorporate specific deadlines for submission and should be auditable in
terms of data sources and collection channels."
"There should also be an independent quality
control process to ensure that erroneous or misleading data is not sent to management."

"CHARACTERISTICS OF KRIs FOR SHARIAH NON-COMPLIANCE RISK –
THE CASE IN MALAYSIAN ISLAMIC FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS
Having a good understanding of the desirable characteristics of a KRI, it comes to the stage
where they must be selected and bundled into a programme for a business area or unit or the
organisation overall."
"Accordingly, the construction of a KRI programme ideally starts with an
individual business unit."
"Based on the Shariah governance framework in Malaysia (Shariah
Governance Framework, 2020) and BNM Operational Risk Integrated Online Network (ORION)
(2021), there are five important components involved in selecting KRIs."
"The selection of the
KRIs should become the agenda of the business unit, Shariah Control Officer (SCO),
management, Shariah committee, and board."
"Each component has specific responsibilities
relating to the risk."
"First, the business unit."
This component is a segment of the organisational structure of an IFI.
"It
represents a specific business function and a definite place on the organisational chart, under the
domain of a manager."
"A business unit may also be referred to as a department, division or a
functional area (such as treasury, compliance and internal audit) within an IFI or of any other
IFIs entity which are working along with them."
"Second, the Shariah Control Officer is referred to
as the employee of an IFI."
"SCO tries to ensure that the Shariah principles, rules, standards and
regulations as provided by the Shariah Committee and Shariah Advisory Council (SAC) at the
Central Bank or other regulatory bodies resolutions are observed by IFI while offering Islamic
finance products and services."
Third is the management of an IFI responsible for managing the business on a daily basis.
"The
management is also responsible for observing and implementing Shariah rulings and decisions
made by the SAC and the Shariah Committee respectively."
"Besides, the management is expected
to provide information and disclosure that are complete and accurate to the Shariah Committee in
a timely manner, and shall be transparent on any areas that need clarification by the Shariah
Committee to enable the Shariah Committee to discharge its duties effectively."
"Hence, it is the
responsibility of the management to allocate adequate resources and manpower to support the
Shariah governance framework that commensurate with the size, complexity, and nature of the
IFI’s business."
"Fourth, Shariah Committee means the Shariah Committee (SC) consisting of minimum five
learned and qualified Shariah scholars appointed as the SC members of an IFI by the board and
approved by the regulator."
"The committee shall be responsible and accountable for all its
decisions, views and opinions related to Shariah matters."
"They also shall be responsible to review
and advise the board on the scenarios and key assumptions regarding risks unique to Shariah
contracts and Shariah non-compliance used in the stress testing programme."
"Lastly is the board
which is a body of elected or appointed members who jointly oversee the activities of an IFI."
"It is
ultimately accountable and responsible for the overall Shariah governance framework and
Shariah compliance of the IFI, by putting in place the appropriate mechanism to discharge the
responsibilities."

Since KRIs are supposed to track key SNCR, the first step in KRI selection is to identify the area
of highest SNCR for the business unit in question."
"It is important to have a consistent and
comprehensive approach to this analysis."
"And this can be done by risk mapping or profiling each
business unit, or leveraging risk-and-control self-assessment (RCSA) or profiling contractual
assessment programmes that are already in place."
"The analysis should focus on component
processes or business functions within each business, considering how they work, and where a
material loss has been or could be experienced."
"Once high-risk areas are identified, businesses should consider existing indicators or metrics that
could be leveraged or new ones created to help anticipate a loss, monitor an exposure, measure
the SNCR, manage the exposure or loss, or report on the SNCR and its implications."
"An
inventory of existing KRIs as suggested in Column 2, Table 2, as well as the identification of the
high SNCR for which there are not currently KRIs in place, is often a good first step in this
process."
"Then, a gap analysis is done."
"Having identified the gaps, it is important to consider a
variety of KRIs against each source of SNCR."
"Each source of SNCR is reported in Column 1,
Table 2."
"Each KRI reflects the specific causal element, which may come into play if a loss occurs."
"Ultimately, however, to keep the number of KRIs being monitored to a manageable number, it is
necessary to select the few that best reflect the business unit’s collective understanding of the
root causes of each potential problem."
"This selection should also be guided by consideration of
the quality of the potential indicators against the effectiveness, comparability, and ease-of-use
criteria discussed above, as well as their contribution to the goal of obtaining a reasonable mix of
leading, current, and lagging indicators."
"This is an art rather than a science at the moment, but, in
the hands of experienced practitioners in the business, should represent a reasonable start."
"Of
course, fine-tuning the KRIs will naturally occur over time as the business learns and gains
experience with these relationships."
"Once selected, each indicator needs to be defined and specified as reported in Column 3, Table 2,
to ensure clarity of interpretation and implementation."
"For example, complaints that have been
lodged by customers pertaining to Shariah non-compliance aspects of Islamic contracts are
included in transparency and proper implementation of Islamic contracts by IFIs (such as legal
documents were not properly signed)."
"The next step is to establish bands of acceptance that essentially codify SNCR appetite, and
triggers for escalation and/or some other form of action."
"For example, on a monthly basis,
Shariah non-compliance matters should be escalated to the Shariah Control Officer and Shariah
Committee Meeting for further clarity or guidance."
"Then, indicators are assessed on an ongoing
basis against this framework of reference."
"In the case of high-frequency, low-impact exposures, it is often useful for managers to think
about different ranges of indicator value as calling for different kinds of action: low-risk range:
no action required; medium-risk range: some action required; and high-risk range: issue to be
escalated to management and board; other actions required urgently to mitigate damage."
Thresholds can be set to define each range and trigger each kind of response.
"After a threshold is
breached, actions taken by managers to accept or mitigate the risk should be recorded."
Thresholds and escalation triggers are important risk management tools.
"KRI thresholds will vary
from IFI to IFI, depending on management’s risk appetite, as well as strategy and ability."
"For
1175
Nurul Syazwani Mohd Noor, Hamizah Muhammad, Juliana Arifin, Puspa Liza Ghazali
SNCR the thresholds may be quite high and others lower."
"They can also change over time, if
there is a strategic decision to manage risk down (or sometimes up)."
"Managers will become more
experienced at setting the appropriate level of threshold over time."
"This is where art meets
science as there can be no one-size-fits-all approach or algorithm for thresholds."
"It is subjective
and based upon the managers’ risk appetite and experience, and that of their peers within the
institutions."
The question is what is a reasonable number of KRIs?
"Many financial institutions have a very
large number."
"This may be justified by the heterogeneity of operational risks and complexity of
financial services and products."
"It is believed that a large diverse institution would reasonably use
between several hundred and a few thousand indicators in middle management."
"Of course, these
cannot all be reported to senior levels of management."
"Accordingly, it is very important to have
an appropriate strategy for reporting and aggregating KRIs to senior management and the board."

"CONCLUSION AND DIRECTIONS FOR FUTURE RESEARCH
SNCR may cause not only unrecognition of income, but also contribute to the implications on the
existing risk profiles such as credit risk, market risk, reputational risk, and legal and compliance
risk."
"In order to mitigate SNCR, this study tries to reach a consensus of which and how many
characteristics must be presented."
"Previous studies have no consensus about which and how
many characteristics must be present in order to select KRIs for SNCR."
"However, the study
reached the ideal characteristics of KRIs such as effective in tracking the risk, comparable within
and outside IFI, and practical as well as easy to use."
"Subsequently, this study has suggested
several KRIs for SNCR to be considered in a stress testing programme, such as number of new
Shariah-related complaints and the amount of impure income as a percentage of total income."
"The results will be great ideas and become a reference for IFIs in structuring their own
comprehensive risk management and internal control system."
