Strengthening Shariah Compliance Risk Culture
By Faizal Jaafar, Mohd Hairi Mohd Tahir and Nurlida Jasmin Ismail
Introduction
Shariah is the central tenet of Islamic fi nance."
"Its principles, which promote fairness and transparency, underpin
the conduct of Islamic fi nance transactions."
"Failures in fully observing Shariah principles can thus affect the
validity and enforceability of Islamic fi nance transactions, and increase fi nancial and non-fi nancial risks for Islamic
fi nancial institutions."
"For example, it is prohibited for Islamic fi nancial institutions to recognise income derived from
transactions that have not fully observed Shariah requirements."
"This could lead to safety and soundness concerns
for an Islamic fi nancial institution."
"Incidents of non-compliances on a broader scale can, in turn, undermine
confi dence in the Islamic fi nancial sector and its stability."
"The effective management of Shariah non-compliance
risk is therefore paramount, especially with the growing signifi cance of Islamic fi nance as a key component of the
fi nancial system, domestically and globally."
"This article highlights the approach by the Bank and the practices of
Islamic fi nancial institutions in inculcating an effective Shariah compliance risk culture."

Shariah Compliance in Malaysia
Section 28 of the Islamic Financial Services Act 2013 (IFSA 2013) requires Islamic fi nancial institutions to ensure that
their aims and operations, business, affairs and activities are aligned to and in compliance with Shariah principles
at all times."
"In practice, Shariah compliance is supported in Malaysia under a two-tier governance structure
that operates at the industry and institutional levels."
"This is further reinforced through the regulatory framework,
supervision and the control functions of Islamic fi nancial institutions."
"a) Centralised Shariah Advisory Council
At the industry level, the Shariah Advisory Council of Bank Negara Malaysia (the SAC) is the highest authority
in the ascertainment of Islamic law for Islamic fi nancial business conducted by institutions regulated by the
Bank."
"While Islam recognises diversity of fi qh interpretations and approaches to implementation, the existence
of a central authority is critical in providing certainty and uniformity in Shariah interpretations."
"The role of the
SAC in providing national level Shariah certainty for Islamic fi nance has enabled the orderly development of the

and
Supervisory
Framework
Islamic fi nancial system, mitigating variations and confl icting Shariah interpretations that may undermine public
confi dence and create gaps in market practices."
"b) Shariah committees of individual Islamic fi nancial institutions
At the institutional level, each Islamic fi nancial institution has a Shariah committee responsible for advising the
management and board on matters relating to Shariah in all aspects of the institution’s business, affairs, practices
and activities."
"While the SAC typically deliberates on industry-wide implications of applying a particular Shariah
principle, the institutional level Shariah committee focuses on Shariah issues that are specifi c to the institution."
"These include those relating to the development of bespoke products and services, as well as business
operations."
"Currently, there are more than 150 qualifi ed Shariah scholars – local and international – who are
appointed as Shariah committee members at 55 Islamic fi nancial institutions."
"c) Shariah risk management, Shariah review and Shariah audit functions
The role of the Shariah committee is supported by designated control functions within Islamic fi nancial institutions,
namely the Shariah risk management, Shariah review and Shariah audit functions."
"These functions are independent
of the business lines and responsible to provide an objective assessment and assurance of the effectiveness of
an Islamic fi nancial institution’s compliance with Shariah and management of Shariah non-compliance risks."
"The
establishment of these control functions and the strengthening of their capacity over time have been instrumental in
promoting a strong Shariah compliance risk culture within Islamic fi nancial institutions."
"d) Regulatory framework
Since 2012, the Bank has issued 14 Shariah Standards and Operational Requirements which give effect to
rulings by the SAC and serve to promote the effective management of risks in Islamic fi nancial business."
"This
has led to enhanced internal policies and processes of Islamic fi nancial institutions to effectively manage Shariah
non-compliance risks in their business undertakings."
"In particular, the regulatory standards have had an important
role in reducing legal and operational risks associated with people and system in the operationalisation and
innovation of Islamic fi nancial products and services."
"The upcoming revision to the Shariah Governance Framework will further strengthen Shariah governance
implementation within institutions."
"The framework outlines specifi c expectations for Shariah considerations to be
more closely integrated with the business and risk strategies of Islamic fi nancial institutions."
"It further clarifi es the
roles, responsibilities and accountabilities of the board, Shariah committee and key organs involved in instituting
a robust Shariah compliance risk culture."
"An increased emphasis is also placed on elevating the professional
competence of individuals who helm these roles in respect of their Shariah knowledge and its applications
to Islamic fi nance."
"Expectations on the independence and quality of control functions to ensure effective
management of Shariah non-compliance risks will also be strengthened under the framework."
"Observations on Shariah Compliance
Shariah applications have wide implications for how an institution operates – encompassing its business practices
and processes to the behaviours of senior management and employees."
"In this section, an overview of Shariah
organisational practices observed in Islamic fi nancial institutions is provided."
"• At the apex, the board and senior management set the tone for the organisational culture and desired
behavioural norms that promote Shariah compliance."
"Increasingly, more Islamic fi nancial institutions are formally
adopting a set of common values and purpose which refl ect Shariah principles and underpin the institutions’
business strategy and risk appetite."
"• Responsibilities for Shariah compliance and risk management are increasingly devolved to business units and
employees, refl ecting an increasing emphasis on the fi rst line of defence in mitigating Shariah non-compliance risks."

This has been accompanied by greater empowerment and accountability accorded to business units, with
greater involvement in the design of business processes and controls to manage Shariah non-compliance risks."
"• Considerations of conduct that impact an Islamic fi nancial institution’s Shariah compliance have become a more
prominent feature of incentive frameworks."
"Most Islamic fi nancial institutions adopt penalty and reward systems
that relate performance measures to Shariah expectations."
"These strategies serve to reinforce a collective focus
of the organisation on ensuring Shariah-compliant practices in all aspects of an Islamic fi nancial institution’s
business, and building a strong risk culture among employees."
"• Greater emphasis has been directed by Islamic fi nancial institutions at building strong foundations in Shariah
knowledge and applications within the workforce."
"Strengthened recruitment practices and higher investment in
training and development have been observed."
"This has been motivated both by an increased focus of Islamic
fi nancial institutions on the sound management of Shariah non-compliance risks, as well as the desire to drive
greater innovation in the offering of Shariah-compliant fi nancial solutions."
"Increased accountability of the Shariah
committees has also encouraged the upskilling of scholars that are appointed to the committees, especially in
areas relating to business operations and industry practices."
"Collectively, these developments have led to better alignment between business operations, processes and practices
with Shariah expectations, thereby mitigating incidents of non-compliance."
"Further details of practices observed
across Islamic fi nancial institutions are elaborated in Diagram 2."
"Conclusion
Moving forward, the Bank expects continued progress in evolving a strong Shariah compliance risk culture that is
well-integrated and self-reinforcing within Islamic fi nancial institutions."
"This in turn will provide the critical foundations
for further growth and innovation in the Islamic fi nance industry, while also contributing to domestic fi nancial stability."
"Consistent with Shariah principles, the adoption of value-based intermediation (VBI) will further sharpen the focus
of Islamic fi nancial institutions in ensuring their products, services and practices deliver a positive and sustainable
impact on the economy, community and environment."
"An increased focus on impact-driven strategies, supported by
strong governance, is expected to be embedded within and well-integrated into the risk management practices and
product innovation strategies of Islamic fi nancial institutions (the progress of VBI implementation is detailed further in
the section on Islamic Finance in Chapter 2)."
"The development of VBI scorecard and disclosure practices will enable
stakeholders to better assess the institutions’ fulfi lment of the basic tenets of Shariah."
"As such, this ensures that
Islamic fi nancial institutions meet the overarching objectives of Shariah (maqasid Shariah) – which are to preserve
and advance the common interest of society at large, by preventing harm and maximising benefi ts."
"This will further
strengthen the accountability, transparency and integrity of Islamic fi nancial institutions."
